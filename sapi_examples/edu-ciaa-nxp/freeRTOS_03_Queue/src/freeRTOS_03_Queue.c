/** @brief Blinky using FreeRTOS.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: It's interesting to check behavior differences between standard and
 * tickless mode. Set @ref configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE to 1, increment a counter
 * in @ref vApplicationTickHook and print the counter value every second
 * inside a task. In standard mode the counter will have a value around 1000.
 * In tickless mode, it will be around 25.
